# Smart-Room--Digital-Twin

Project Overview
This project creates a digital twin of a smart room, allowing for interactive control and visualization of various room components. The simulation is built using Unity and scripted in C#.​

Features
Door Control with PIN: Implements a security feature where doors can be locked or unlocked using a PIN code.

Lighting System: Controls the room's lighting, allowing for toggling lights on and off.

Fan Simulation: Includes multiple fan controllers (SpinFan1.cs to SpinFan4.cs) to simulate fan operations.

LED Indicators: Manages LED states within the room.

First-Person Controller: Enables user navigation within the virtual room environment.​
